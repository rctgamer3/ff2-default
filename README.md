# Firefox 2, the theme, reloaded
The default Firefox 2 theme (designed/made by Radiant Core) updated for Firefox 55 and above.

**This (complete) theme will stop working on November 14, 2017 because Complete Themes will stop working in Firefox 57.**
However, if and when the new Theming API is mature enough to continue developing the theme on/for, I'll be sure to try and make a WebExtension version of the theme.

For now: "_So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish._"
